# 5G-Deep-Learning
The repository contains the project did for the Research Methodologies course at @KTH (EIT Data Science Master Programme)

## Description
The aim of the project was to develop an intrusion detection system using Deep Learning Algorithms. The main implementation is done using Tensorflow following the feature work of another paper [http://www.covert.io/research-papers/deep-learning-security/A%20Deep%20Learning%20Approach%20for%20Network%20Intrusion%20Detection%20System.pdf].

### The solution
The proposed solution is a Deep Neural Network composed by a Stacked Autoencoder in the first layers to extract the most meaningful features followed by a Softmax Regression for classification purposes.
